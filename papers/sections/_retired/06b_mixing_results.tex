\section{Numerical CKM/PMNS verification results}
\label{sec:mixing_results}

This section records the fixed numerical outputs of the scan-and-match protocol
defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:formal_verification}. The values below are generated
by the repository verification script and exported as a LaTeX block to ensure
auditability.

\subsection{Quark sector (CKM)}

\subsection{Lepton sector (PMNS)}

The PMNS scan is performed with the leptonic $ and the
specified leptonic $\theta_\star$. The exported block above includes the
resulting $\delta_{\mathrm{PMNS}}$ and {\mathrm{PMNS}}$.

\paragraph{Reproducibility.}
The outputs in this section are regenerated by running:
\texttt{python .\textbackslash code\textbackslash verify\_mixing.py}
with the same inputs recorded in the exported block.
