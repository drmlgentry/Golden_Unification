\section{Null hypotheses and comparison ensembles}
\label{sec:null_hypotheses}

To assess whether the observed lattice alignment exceeds chance expectation,
we define explicit null hypotheses and comparison ensembles.

\subsection{Randomized spectra}

As a baseline, fermion masses are randomized within their empirical ranges
while preserving the overall hierarchy scale. These ensembles test whether
apparent lattice structure arises generically in logarithmic spectra.

\subsection{Anchor-randomized controls}

Anchoring choices are randomized subject to the same constraints applied in
the primary analysis. This tests sensitivity to arbitrary coordinate choices.

\subsection{Permutation tests}

Integer assignments are permuted within scan bounds to assess whether the
observed residual distributions differ significantly from combinatorial
expectation.

All null ensembles are generated using the same deterministic pipeline as
the primary analysis, with no manual intervention.
