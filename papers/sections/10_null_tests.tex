\section{Null-hypothesis verification}
\label{sec:null_tests}

We now report the outcome of the null tests defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:null_hypotheses}.

\subsection{Outcome summary}

Across all tested null ensembles, lattice alignment comparable to that
observed in the empirical spectrum occurs with low frequency. Residual
distributions and multiplicity counts differ systematically from those
obtained in randomized controls.

\subsection{Interpretation of null results}

These results indicate that the observed lattice structure is unlikely to
arise generically from logarithmic scaling alone. They do not, however,
identify a causal mechanism.

\subsection{Audit closure}

Together with the mass and mixing verifications, the null tests close the
audit loop for this paper. All claims are bounded, reproducible, and subject
to explicit failure criteria.

No additional interpretation is required to support the conclusions drawn here.
