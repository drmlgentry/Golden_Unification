\section{Anchored Integer-Lattice Fits}
\label{sec:integer_fits}

We present results for the anchored lattice in which the electron defines the reference convention
($\Delta_e=0$, $q_e=0$). All other particles are fit by scanning integer triples $(a,b,c)$ within
declared bounds and minimizing the absolute residual $\epsilon = |\delta|$.

\subsection{Best-fit solutions}

Table~\ref{tab:mass_fits} summarizes representative best-fit assignments for the audited mass set.
The quantity $\delta$ is the signed logarithmic discrepancy defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:signed_delta}.
Fit quality is assessed using $\epsilon = |\delta|$ (Eq.~\eqref{eq:epsilon_def}).

\subsection{Multiplicity and uniqueness}

Within the scanned bounds, solutions are deduplicated by $q$. Several particles admit multiple
integer realizations at loose tolerance, but collapse to unique $q$ values under anchoring. The
reported values should therefore be interpreted as best-fit representatives of the deduplicated
solution sets.

\subsection{Scope of mass-sector claims}

The mass results establish the following limited statement:

\begin{quote}
Within declared scan bounds and a fixed anchoring convention, the anchored lattice intersects
observed fermion mass scales with bounded logarithmic residuals and controlled multiplicity after
deduplication by $q$.
\end{quote}

No dynamical mechanism is assumed or inferred from these fits. The role of the mass analysis is to
document a discrete regularity and to specify falsification criteria under explicit, auditable
conventions.
