\section{PMNS extension and leptonic CP phase}
\label{sec:pmns}

We next apply the same verification logic to the lepton sector.
The goal is to test whether the leptonic CP phase exhibits consistency
with the same audit principles used for quarks.

\subsection{Conventions and inputs}

We use standard global-fit values for the PMNS mixing angles and adopt
a fixed phase convention. As in the CKM case, no optimization or tuning
is performed.

\subsection{Invariant measure}

Leptonic CP violation is quantified using the corresponding Jarlskog
invariant, defined analogously to the quark case. The invariant nature
of this diagnostic allows direct comparison across conventions.

\subsection{Verification outcome}

Under the declared conventions, the predicted sign and magnitude of
the leptonic CP phase are consistent with current global-fit ranges.
Given existing experimental uncertainties, this agreement should be
interpreted conservatively.

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate internal consistency,
not to claim a precise prediction of the leptonic CP phase.
