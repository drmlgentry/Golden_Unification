\section{Formal verification and audit closure}
\label{sec:formal_verification}

This section summarizes the logical status of the verification results
reported above and closes the audit loop for mixing observables.

\subsection{Determinism and reproducibility}

All verification steps are deterministic once inputs and conventions
are declared. Independent implementations using the same inputs must
reproduce the same CP-invariant values.

\subsection{Degrees of freedom}

No free parameters are introduced in the verification stage. All
degrees of freedom are fixed prior to evaluation. This constraint
is essential to falsifiability.

\subsection{Audit status}

The verification results satisfy the same audit criteria applied to
the mass lattice: fixed conventions, bounded inputs, invariant
diagnostics, and reproducibility.

No additional claims are implied beyond this verified consistency.
