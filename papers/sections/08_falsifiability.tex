\section{Falsifiability and failure modes}
\label{sec:falsifiability}

This framework is falsifiable in multiple independent ways.
Because it relies on fixed conventions and bounded scans, it makes definite
claims that can fail under controlled tests.

\subsection{Anchor dependence}

If the observed lattice alignment disappears under small, non-optimized
changes of anchoring choice, the framework would lose explanatory value.
Robustness under declared anchors is therefore a necessary condition.

\subsection{Residual inflation}

The lattice hypothesis fails if the residuals required to maintain integer
assignments systematically grow as data improve, rather than shrinking or
remaining stable.

\subsection{Multiplicity explosion}

A dramatic increase in the number of admissible integer assignments under
fixed scan bounds would indicate that the apparent structure is not
meaningfully constraining.

\subsection{Sector inconsistency}

Failure of the same framework to apply consistently across fermion sectors
would constitute strong evidence against a unified organizing principle.

These criteria are explicit and testable. Failure under any one of them is
sufficient to reject the framework in its present form.
