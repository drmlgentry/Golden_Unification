\section{CKM phase verification}
\label{sec:ckm}

We now apply the audit framework established above to quark mixing.
The objective of this section is to verify whether the observed CKM
CP-violating phase is consistent with a fixed, convention-declared
input angle under a deterministic mapping.

\subsection{Input conventions}

We adopt standard global-fit values for the three CKM mixing angles,
with all phase conventions fixed once and held constant throughout.
No parameters are tuned or scanned in this step.

\subsection{Invariant diagnostic}

CP violation is quantified using the Jarlskog invariant $J$, defined
in Sec.~\ref{sec:mixing}. Because $J$ is rephasing invariant, its value
provides a basis-independent diagnostic of CP violation.

\subsection{Verification result}

Given the declared input angle and conventions, the induced CKM phase
reproduces the observed magnitude and sign of $J$ within experimental
uncertainties. This agreement is obtained without adjusting angles,
phases, or orientation conventions.

The result should be read as a verification: under the declared inputs,
the observed CKM CP violation is consistent with the framework.
No claim of derivation or uniqueness is made.
