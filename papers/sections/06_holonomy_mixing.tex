\section{Holonomy-phase interpretation of mixing}
\label{sec:holonomy_mixing}

This section provides a geometric interpretation of the phase-selection
procedure used in the verification of CKM and PMNS CP violation.
It does not introduce new inputs or alter the verification pipeline.

\subsection{Interpretive framework}

Once a fixed input angle is declared, its propagation to observable
phases may be viewed geometrically as a holonomy associated with an
orientation choice. This perspective offers a compact way to encode
sign information and convention dependence.

\subsection{Scope of interpretation}

The holonomy language is used here strictly as an interpretive aid.
No claim is made that the Standard Model dynamics generate such a
holonomy, nor that it is unique or fundamental.

The value of this perspective is organizational: it clarifies why
phase sign and orientation are stable once conventions are fixed.

\subsection{Relation to verification results}

The numerical agreement reported in the preceding sections does not
depend on this interpretation. The holonomy picture merely provides
a geometric narrative consistent with the deterministic verification
pipeline already established.
