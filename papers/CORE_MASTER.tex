\section{Conclusion}

We have presented an empirical analysis of the fermion mass spectrum in logarithmic coordinates and identified a discrete clustering structure under fixed conventions. The analysis is intentionally conservative: it documents the observed regularity, characterizes deviations from exact discreteness, and evaluates its non-triviality without invoking a theoretical mechanism.

The results reported here do not establish an origin for the observed structure, nor do they imply the existence of an underlying symmetry or dynamical principle. Instead, they define a concrete empirical pattern whose status can be assessed independently of interpretation. Whether the structure reflects a deeper organizing principle or arises coincidentally remains an open question.

To clarify this distinction, a companion paper provides a detailed numerical validation of the present results, including reproducibility under independent implementation, stability under perturbations of the input data, and explicit falsifiability criteria. That analysis is designed to ensure that the empirical claim advanced here is well defined, auditable, and meaningfully testable.

Future work may explore possible interpretations or extensions of the observed regularity. The purpose of the present paper, however, is limited to establishing the empirical observation itself and delineating the conditions under which it persists or fails.
