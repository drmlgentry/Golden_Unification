\title{Paper II: Encoding Map, Anchoring Conventions, and Bounded Scan Methodology}
\author{Marvin Gentry}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We formalize a reproducible and auditable methodology for mapping bounded
integer lattices into logarithmic structure, motivated by empirical clustering
observed in particle mass ratios. The focus of this paper is not phenomenological
interpretation but methodological control: defining an explicit encoding map,
fixing anchoring conventions that remove trivial rescaling degeneracies, and
specifying bounded scan protocols that prevent post hoc fitting.

We introduce a discrete linear encoding with no continuous parameters and show
how anchoring conditions uniquely define relative logarithmic assignments.
A systematic scan procedure is presented, together with null tests and stability
checks that distinguish structural features from artifacts of scan bounds or
numerical coincidence.

All numerical results are generated by deterministic scripts and included in the
manuscript exclusively via version-controlled \LaTeX{} artifacts, ensuring full
traceability and eliminating transcription error. Negative results and excluded
configurations are retained as first-class outputs.

This paper establishes a methodological contract for subsequent work: any claimed
structure must persist under bounded scans, anchoring changes, and explicit null
tests. Physical interpretation is intentionally deferred; the contribution here
is a controlled, falsifiable framework for exploring discrete logarithmic
structure in particle data.
