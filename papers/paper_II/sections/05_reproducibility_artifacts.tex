\section{Reproducibility Artifacts}

A central objective of this work is full numerical reproducibility. To this end, all reported tables and figures are generated directly from code and included verbatim in the manuscript.

The repository accompanying this paper contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the complete set of scan scripts,
  \item fixed configuration files specifying anchors and bounds,
  \item generated outputs in both raw and \LaTeX-ready formats.
\end{itemize}

Manual transcription of numerical results is explicitly avoided. Instead, the manuscript inputs generated \LaTeX blocks directly from the repository to eliminate copy-and-paste errors.

All scripts are deterministic and require no random seeds. Given the same inputs, the outputs are guaranteed to be identical across runs and platforms, up to floating-point precision.

This approach allows independent readers to reproduce every numerical claim in this paper using a single command, providing a transparent audit trail from raw data to published result.
