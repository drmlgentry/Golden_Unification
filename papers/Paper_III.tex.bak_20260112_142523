\begin{abstract}
We report scan-based empirical results for a discrete log-lattice description of selected Standard Model masses.
Working in logarithmic space with a golden-ratio base $\phiG=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$, we search integer triples $(a,b,c)\in\mathbb{Z}^3$
that minimize relative log-error for each particle under an exponent model of the form
$\log_{\phiG}(m/m_0)=q/4$ with $q = 8a+15b+24c$ (anchored normalization). We provide (i) best-fit triples within bounded regions,
(ii) multiplicity counts (uniqueness versus degeneracy when deduplicating by $q$), and (iii) stability notes and falsifiability criteria
for avoiding overfit. The present paper is deliberately empirical: it documents what the scans return, how sensitive those results are,
and what constitutes a prediction rather than a fit.
\end{abstract}

\section{Scope and positioning}
This paper documents \emph{results and diagnostics} produced by a deterministic scan. It does \emph{not} claim a derived mass-generation
mechanism. Its purpose is to make the empirical claims legible, reproducible, and reviewable: what fit quality is achieved, what the
solution multiplicity is, and how strongly the output depends on anchoring conventions and scan bounds.

\section{Model, anchoring, and error metric}
Let $\phiG=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. For a particle of mass $m$ we consider a discrete exponent model
\begin{equation}
\log_{\phiG}\!\left(\frac{m}{m_0}\right) \approx \frac{q}{4}, \qquad
q := 8a + 15b + 24c,\quad (a,b,c)\in\mathbb{Z}^3 .
\label{eq:model}
\end{equation}
We use an \emph{anchored} convention in which the electron defines the reference exponent by enforcing $q_e=0$ for the electron,
i.e. a chosen triple $(a_e,b_e,c_e)$ sets the additive offset so that the electron is exactly fit by construction.

To measure fit quality we use a relative log-error:
\begin{equation}
\eps := \frac{\log(m_{\text{pred}}/m_{\text{exp}})}{\log(m_{\text{exp}})} ,
\label{eq:error}
\end{equation}
or the equivalent relative discrepancy in $\log$-space (the implementation details are fixed by the scan script and recorded in the results block).
We report $\eps$ for best-fit solutions and we also report multiplicity counts: how many distinct integer solutions exist within bounds
at a stated tolerance, optionally deduplicated by $q$.

\section{Scan protocol}
The scan searches integer triples $(a,b,c)$ in a bounded rectangular region of $\mathbb{Z}^3$ and selects the minimizer of $|\eps|$ per particle.
To diagnose overfitting risk, we also count how many triples satisfy $|\eps|\le \eps_{\max}$ within the scan bounds, with a deduplication option:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Raw multiplicity:} number of satisfying $(a,b,c)$.
\item \textbf{Unique($q$) multiplicity:} number of satisfying solutions after deduplicating by the derived exponent $q$.
\end{itemize}
Large multiplicity signals potential non-uniqueness and motivates reporting \emph{solution sets} rather than a single best triple.

\section{Results block (auto-generated)}
\label{sec:resultsblock}
The following block is written by the repository script into \texttt{shared/paperIII\_results.tex}.
It contains the authoritative scan bounds, anchor triple, tolerance settings, and the produced tables.

\section{Visualizations}
This repository also stores figure outputs under \texttt{figures/}. If the PDFs exist, they can be included directly.

\section{Interpretation and limitations}
The scan output can show striking regularities; however, interpretation requires discipline:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Anchoring is a convention.} An anchor triple fixes offsets and can shift which integer triples appear ``simple.''
We therefore report the anchor explicitly and keep it fixed across runs unless stated.
\item \textbf{Multiplicity matters.} A good best-fit is not compelling if thousands of solutions exist in the same bounds at the same tolerance.
Any claim must therefore include uniqueness/multiplicity diagnostics.
\item \textbf{Running and scheme dependence.} Quark masses and electroweak parameters depend on scale and renormalization scheme.
A robust regularity should persist under reasonable choices of inputs (within uncertainties) and updated PDG values.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Falsifiability and preregistration rules}
To prevent post-hoc tuning, we adopt the following rules for future work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fix scan bounds and tolerance \emph{before} looking at new targets.
\item Report \emph{all} solutions within tolerance (or at least the multiplicity and the full set of distinct $q$ values).
\item Treat any parameter change (bounds, tolerance, anchor choice) as a new experiment and report it as such.
\end{itemize}

\section{Next steps}
Immediate technical next steps for the repo (not claims about physics):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Replace placeholder PDFs with generated plots from the scan outputs.
\item Emit CSV tables under \texttt{data/derived/} and build LaTeX tables from those deterministically.
\item Extend the analysis to CKM/PMNS phases (handled in later papers) under identical reproducibility constraints.
\end{enumerate}
