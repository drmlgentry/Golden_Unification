From this moment forward:

Only full papers go in papers/

Only modular inputs go in shared/

Only verification lives in code/

Nothing else writes LaTeX except scripts explicitly designed to do so

Concretely:

Folder	What belongs there
papers/	Paper_I.tex … Paper_VIII.tex (full documents or full sections)
shared/	macros.tex, references.bib, paperIII_results.tex, paperV_mixing_results.tex
code/	Python / PS scripts that produce results
math/	derivations you are not yet ready to publish
notes/	planning, consolidation ideas, submission strategy

🌟 Anchor A — Flavor Geometry Core (JHEP-class)

Consolidated from:

Paper III (anchored mass lattice)

Paper V (CKM + PMNS holonomy, verified)

This paper does:

defines the lattice cleanly,

proves stability/uniqueness where it exists,

connects directly to CKM & PMNS data,

includes code-backed verification.

This is your technical flagship.


🌟 Anchor B — Geometric Interpretation & Extensions (EPJC-class)

Consolidated from:

Paper IV (geometric interpretation)

Paper VI (extensions / sensitivity / limitations)

This paper does:

interprets without overclaiming,

explains why the structure is nontrivial,

addresses degeneracy honestly,

frames the result as empirical geometry.

This is where skeptics feel respected.


🌟 Anchor C — Cross-Scale Structure (EPJC or CQG-class)

Consolidated from:

Paper VII (gravity & cosmology)

supported by Paper VIII (scope & falsifiability)

This paper does:

shows consistency across scales,

draws a hard line between observation and speculation,

uses VIII’s falsifiability logic explicitly.

This is optional for first wave submission — important but not urgent.

🛰 Satellites (kept as standalone or notes)

Paper I (historical / exploratory)

Paper II (early structure)

Paper VIII (synthesis & falsifiability — can remain standalone or be merged)

These increase credibility but do not need to be submitted first.

Your paper currently does four legitimate things:

Identifies discrete regularities in fermion mass ratios and mixing data

Shows these regularities are non-generic (via null tests and degeneracy accounting)

Demonstrates that phase-sensitive observables (CKM/PMNS) admit a holonomy interpretation

It does not construct modular forms of weight

It does not specify a modulus

It does not assign SM fields to irreducible

It does not derive Yukawa textures from modular invariance

That is exactly why the current paper is strong: it stays falsifiable and disciplined.
